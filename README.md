# quicksort and mergesort

This python package is designed for sorting numbers using different quicksort and mergesort algorithms.

It accepted user input in the form of a text file containing numbers, or a file containing a list of files in the same executing directory
and output to the same directory as the input file.

It can also perform optional actions, including printing information of sort type, no. of comparison, no. of exchange, processing time(ns), with the appropriate argument input. 

## How to download and run:

1. Download and install Python on your computer
2. Navigate to [this](.) directory (containing the README.md)
3. Run the program as a module: `python -m sorter -h`. This will print the help message.
4. Run the program as a module (with real inputs): `python -m sorter <input_file> -`
   a. IE: `python -m sorter file/number.txt`

Output of the sorted numbers, with statistics will be written to an output file with name echoing the input file after processing the input file.

## Sorter Project Package and Layout

This project have a single module in a single package.
Here is huffman package explained.

* [sorter/](.): The parent package folder.
    * [README.md](README):
      The guide for using this converter
    * [sorter](sorter): 
      This is the *module* in this *package*.
      * [`__init__.py`](sorter/__init__.py) 
        
      * [`__main__.py`](sorter/__main__.py) 
        This file is the entrypoint to the sorter when ran as a program. It handles the command line arguments and do all functions calling and output.
      * `insertionsort.py` 
        This the function to do an insertion sort on an input array and output it.
      * `mergesort.py` 
        This the function to do a generic mergesort on an input array and output it. 
      * `msort_helper.py` 
        This is the merge function to merge two input array and output one array 
      * `nmglinked.py` 
        This the function to do a natural mergesort with a linked list implementation on an input array and output it.
      * `qsort1st.py` 
        This is the function to do a quicksort with 1st element as pivot on an input array and output it.
      * `qsort10.py` 
        This is the function to do a quicksort with 1st element as pivot, switch to insertion sort when partition size is 10 or less, on an input array and output it.
      * `qsort50.py` 
        This is the function to do a quicksort with 1st element as pivot, switch to insertion sort when partition size is 50 or less, on an input array and output it.
      * `qsort100.py` 
        This is the function to do a quicksort with 1st element as pivot, switch to insertion sort when partition size is 100 or less, on an input array and output it.
      * `qsortmo3.py` 
        This is the function to do a quicksort with median of 3 as pivot, on an input array and output it.
      * `sorterhelper.py` 
        This contained the self defined linked list Class ADT "nmnode", some extra helper functions to convert a linked list to array, other IO functions to perform reading and output.

## Input and Output format:

For this sorter function to function properly, user must supply a legitimate file path as argument,and by default, without specifying optional [-l] [-t] [-a] arguments.
The file is a txt file containing the numbers to be sorted. The program will output the results to a text file at the same directory as the input file.

User can also [-l] argument to indicated that input file is in fact a lists of files containing numbers to be sorted, the program will then process all files one by one.

Without the [-l] argument, the input file should be itself a txt file containing numbers.

With the [-l] argument, the input file should be itself a list of txt file containing numbers, with each line corresponding to a single file e.g. "set1.txt" .

Each number txt file should be in a line by line format, with each line corresponding to a single number e.g. "9999" .

Any space/ tabs/ character inside the input file or number file will be trimmed. Each empty line will be recorded and printed on output for user reference
There is no limitation on number of files or quantity of numbers to be sorted, but input should contain only numbers.

The module will then print the output statistics or information to an output txt file at the same directory as the input number file.
It will only print sorted numbers to output file if the input number file is with size 50 or less

### Example input and output

>An example of sorter printout, with the default quicksort median of 3 sorting algorithm
> 
>From Input file : `line1:3 , line2: 1, , line3: 2`
> 
>In Output file:
> 
>`From /xxx/number.txt:`
> 
>`The sorted elements are:`
> 
>`1 2 3`
> 
> `Total no. of sorted elements: 3`
> 
> `Total no. of comparison/exchanges make is 6 and 2`
